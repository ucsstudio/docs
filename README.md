Blockchain trilemma, Decentralization, Scalability and Security has always been a trade off amongst themselves. When decentralized, it won't be secured, 
when secured, it will be slow and not scalable. UCS is a cross-chain society focused on utilizing technology to solve these core on chain problems.

<h4>UCS is focused on: </h4>

Bringing optimal and simultaneous solution to the blockchain trilemma 

Solving core on-chain problems without tying it to a single chain

Building a community where builders from various chains can work together seamlessly




<h4>The Trilemma:</h4>

The Blockchain Trilemma refers to a widely held belief that decentralized networks can only provide two of three benefits at any given time with respect to decentralization, security, and scalability. A strong believe that the blockchain cannot achieve the optimal level of three core properties. 

<h4>Team </h4>

UCS team consist of the best brains in the space, the rebels, people who don't like something not being as good as it can be, builders from various chains who has actually built something
